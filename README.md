# reg-analysis
There are a lot of different way of using linear models. Today sofisticated models like random forest, boosting or neural networks are much more popular. 
Sometimes however it is good to use linear models. In this project I want to show how linear models can be used and compare them with 
mentioned more flexible models.

## Notebooks:
* taxi duration - In this competition, the challenge is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. 
* bike sharing - This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bike share system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
* wine quality - This datasets is used to predict pH of wines.
* splines - Implementation of splines from scratch.
* base_reg - Example of using statsmodels.
* walmart - in progress.
